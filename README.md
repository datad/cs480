## CS480 - summer 2020

### Prep before course starts


#### Textbooks

I will not require any textbook due to the hardship that many students may have suffered, but I will suggest that any book from the following list is useful:
 
Paid textbooks:
Silberschatz, A., Korth, H. F., & Sudarshan, S. (1997). Database system concepts. New York: McGraw-Hill. 7th Edition. Book web site: http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/avi/db-book/index.html
Lake, P., & Crowther, P. (2013). Concise guide to databases. Springer, London.
 
Open textbooks:
Watt, A. (2014). Database Design - 2nd Edition. https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/database-design-2nd-edition
 
I would argue that any other textbook on database design or SQL will be useful for this course, but I can review any other textbook that you have if you want me to take a look.
 
During the summer, I will be evaluating a zybook that will be available the upcoming Fall (it's not ready yet). However, I spoke with the publishers, and maybe they can make it available to UIC students sooner. I'll hear back from them this week.

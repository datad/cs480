## CS480 - summer 2020

### Prep before course starts


#### Textbooks

I will not require any textbook due to the hardship that many students may have suffered, but I will suggest that any book from the following list is useful:
 
Paid textbooks:
Silberschatz, A., Korth, H. F., & Sudarshan, S. (1997). Database system concepts. New York: McGraw-Hill. 7th Edition. Book web site: http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/avi/db-book/index.html
Lake, P., & Crowther, P. (2013). Concise guide to databases. Springer, London.
 
Open textbooks:
Watt, A. (2014). Database Design - 2nd Edition. https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/database-design-2nd-edition
 
I would argue that any other textbook on database design or SQL will be useful for this course, but I can review any other textbook that you have if you want me to take a look.
 
During the summer, I will be evaluating a zybook that will be available the upcoming Fall (it's not ready yet). However, I spoke with the publishers, and maybe they can make it available to UIC students sooner. I'll hear back from them this week.


#### Basic topics

Summer classes can be intense because we are compressing the content of 17 weeks semester into eight weeks, but do not worry, You can do it!
It would be great if you can start learning SQL. 
With a quick search, I found some intro to SQL videos
Feel free to ask me questions about any of these videos, and comments
